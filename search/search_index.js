Note that if this value is specified, Terraform will need kms:Encrypt, kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey permissions on this KMS key.  </li> <li><code>sse_customer_key</code> - The key to use for encrypting state with Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). This is the base64-encoded value of the key, which must decode to 256 bits. This can also be sourced from the <code>AWS_SSE_CUSTOMER_KEY</code> environment variable, which is recommended due to the sensitivity of the value.

You should use the correct region based on your configuration.</p> <p>I also migrate <code>iac-base</code> Terraform state file to this remote backend.</p> <p>Migration from local to a remote backend is EASIER than moving resources from Earth to Mars. You only need to run <code>terraform init</code>. Terraform detects the new backend configuration, and asks about migrating:  </p> <pre><code>    $ terraform init \n\n    Initializing the backend...\n    Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?\n      Pre-existing state was found while migrating the previous \"local\" backend to the\n      newly configured \"s3\" backend. No existing state was found in the newly\n      configured \"s3\" backend. Do you want to copy this state to the new \"s3\"\n      backend? Enter \"yes\" to copy and \"no\" to start with an empty state.\n\n      Enter a value: yes\n\n    Releasing state lock. This may take a few moments...\n\n    Successfully configured the backend \"s3\"! Terraform will automatically\n    use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.\n\n    Initializing provider plugins...\n    - Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file\n    - Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v4.57.0\n\n    Terraform has been successfully initialized!\n\n    You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see\n    any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands\n    should now work.\n\n    If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,\n    rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other\n    commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.\n</code></pre> <p>One of the core concepts of the IaC is about writing one time, and use several times. For example, you can use the same resource implementation to deploy in several environments such as Development, Test, Stage, or Production. Then it comes to a concept called multi-account and multi-backend architecture. I will discuss this concept in a separate blog. </p>","tags":["Terraform"]},{"location":"blog/tf-mars.html#changing-the-s3-bucket","title":"Changing the S3 Bucket","text":"<p>I always say it is better to consider all details before implementation. A design document including all the project details can prevent most future issues. For instance, naming conventions is one of my criteria. But it might happen that you should change the state S3 bucket to another bucket. In this case, Terraform can move your state file from one bucket to another bucket using <code>terraform init -migrate-state</code>. In the below code block, I try to move state file from <code>terraforming-mars-tfstate</code> bucket to <code>terraforming-venus-next-tfstate</code>:  </p> <pre><code>    terraform {\n      required_providers {\n        aws = {\n          source = \"hashicorp/aws\"\n        }\n      }\n      backend \"s3\" {\n        bucket         = \"terraforming-venus-next-tfstate\"\n        key            = \"terraform.state\"\n        region         = \"eu-west-1\"\n        encrypt        = true\n        dynamodb_table = \"terraforming-venus-next-locktable\"\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>","tags":["Terraform"]},{"location":"blog/tf-mars.html#best-practices","title":"Best practices","text":"<p>Enable encryption for S3 bucket: Using encryption for the state file in the S3 bucket. State files can contain secrets, keys, etc. in plaintext. So, it is important to keep it encrypted. AWS S3 backend supports different encryption methods: </p> <ul> <li><code>encrypt</code> - Enable server side encryption of the state file.  </li> <li><code>kms_key_id</code> - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Key Management Service (KMS) Key to use for encrypting the state. Note that if this value is specified, Terraform will need kms:Encrypt, kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey permissions on this KMS key.  </li> <li><code>sse_customer_key</code> - The key to use for encrypting state with Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). This is the base64-encoded value of the key, which must decode to 256 bits. This can also be sourced from the <code>AWS_SSE_CUSTOMER_KEY</code> environment variable, which is recommended due to the sensitivity of the value. Setting it inside a terraform file will cause it to be persisted to disk in terraform.tfstate.  </li> </ul> <p>Enable S3 bucket versioning: Enabling bucket versioning on the S3 bucket is strongly advised as it enables recovery of the state in case of unintended deletions and mistakes.  </p> <p>Enable retention lifecycle policy: As S3 bucket versioning enables, it is wise to have a retention lifecycle policy to delete the old state file objects. You can add <code>noncurrent_version_expiration</code> policy based on your project/organization definition.  </p> <p>Suggested structure for single-environment projects: This is only a suggestion based on my experience with how to have a structure for your Terraform projects. As we discussed it is a good idea to have a project called <code>iac-based</code> including all your base configurations. For example, resources for your Terraform backend:</p> <pre><code>$ tree                                                                               \n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 iac-base\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 search-planet-x-state.tf\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 tf-mars-state.tf\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 tf-venus-state.tf\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 searching-for-planet-x\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 terraforming-mars\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 terraforming-venus\n</code></pre>","tags":["Terraform"]}]}
